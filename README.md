# My Octave 

#### Contributor: Dumitrascu Filip-Teodor

## Project description

> The idea of the project is the understanding and correct use of the functions that use dynamic allocation, being performed various operations on matrices within them. So, an octave application simulator is implemented.

## Project structure 

* Makefile
> Includes build and clean rules.

* Readme
> Includes detailed project overview.

* my_octave.c
> The program relies in main on repeated queries of the letter read from the
keyboard. Given the letter read, a function is called which processes the
matrix vector "array", the line vector "rows" and the vector of columns
"columns" into the desired result. Thus we consider the following:
    
    - for the letter "L" increase the size of the matrix vector by 1 allocate space for the matrix and read the matrix.

    - for the letter "P" display the values of the matrix.

    - for the letter "D" display the dimensions of the matrix from the rows vector and the columns vector.

    - for the letter "C" read the elements to be stored in the matrix, put then in the dynamically allocated "resized" matrix and consider by pointing as the matrix resized being the new matrix.

    - for the letter "M" if the multiplication condition of two matrices is met, increase the size of the matrix vector by 1, allocate space for matrix, take into account the size of the resulting matrix and calculate the product.

    - for the letter "O" calculate the sum of the elements of each matrix and the values are sorted by a bubble sort.

    - for the letter "T" put in the dynamically allocated "transposed" matrix the elements and consider by pointing as the matrix transposed being the new matrix.

    - for the letter "R" a unit matrix "raised" and a temporary matrix "temp" with which is calculated the power of the matrix in a logharithmic complexity Matrix "temp" takes the value 0 after each multiplication so that it can be reused and the "raised" matrix is placed in the vector as the new matrix.

    - for the letter "F" the memory for the indicated matrix is released and the one position per matrix, eliminating from the total number of matrices of the vector. 

    - for the letter "Q" the total memory is cleared starting with the matrices and ending with the matrix, row and column vectors.
